			<h2>My Secondary School<br><br></h2>
			<p>I was lucky to get to study in a new school where my mother was stationed at as a Penolong Kanan. The name of the school is Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sierramas. My mother taught me Bahasa Melayu in my form 4 and form 5, and as I have got to learn from the best teacher, that is exactly why I aced it in my SPM.<br></p></div>

			<h2>My University<br><br></h2>
			<p>I am studying for a diploma in Information Management. I am waiting for the approval of my application of Fast Track to a Degree study in the same field. I would like to follow my eldest sister's to become a programmer, but I'll be a bit different, which is a Data Scientist.<br></p></div>
