		<p> Anis Maisarah Binti Zubir is the name given by both of my beloved parents Mr. Zubir Bin Omar and Mrs. Nurun Saadah Binti Yusof.
		Indeed, I was the last child out of 10 siblings.
		Besides, I was safely born in Hospital Selayang on the 13th March 2001 and currently is living with my family in Subang.</p>

		<br> Additionally, my education since primary school until the secondary school was located in Sekolah Kebangsaan Gombak Setia and moved to Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Rahman Putra. When I was 12 years old, I again moved to Sekolah Kebangsaan Subang Bestari and taken my UPSR there. After that, when I was 13 years old, I went to school at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sierramas until I finished my school.
		Nevertheless, I am currently pursuing my Diploma study in the field of Information Management at University Technology Mara UiTM Rembau, Negeri Sembilan.
		Most importantly, my ambition is absolutely to be one of the successful Web Content Managers in a well-known company and currently I am struggling on my study in an effort to achieve my future goals.
		<br>
		<br>
		Therefore I do believe from this words that always motivated me and encourage me, that helps me when having difficulties in doing something in studying or pursuing my career:

			"Verily with Hardship comes ease"
 		</i></blockquote>

 		<br>
 		<p>"Daripada sekecil-kecil perkara hingga besar, pasti ada solusinya"</p>

 		<br><p> I think, I was the person that a bit cheerful when I'm with people that I closed to. 
 		In fact, several values that can be seen in myself are I am the responsible and hardworking person especially in completing my task before the due date as to prevent procrastination.
		Besides, I am also the loving person especially towards the animal such as cat since I personally have a few cats that I enjoy to take care of them.
		Additionally, I am very passionate towards my hobby which is cycling the adventure downhill bike with my younger brother and as well as my father.
		Surprisingly, I have brought my hobby into the several stages for winning during the competition organized by <abbr title="Sukan Malaysia">SUKMA</abbr> Other than that, I also love to decorate the interior living space especially my room since it feels like a therapy to see the tidy and mesmerize room.
		In conclusion, above are the information about myself and I am looking to be the better person and succesful person in the future.</p> <br>
